changes:
  - balance: "Synths can now use twitch (and by extension, the qani-laaca computer), both synths and those with vein muscles will be heated up massively by twitch, rather than taking heart damage."
  - bugfix: "The radial blur overlay for twitch now once again works properly, meaning you won't be basically entirely blinded by it anymore."
