  Melbert:
  - qol: Socially Anxious people should be able to talk a bit more clearer while still
      maintaining the stuttering "charm"
  Melbret:
  - bugfix: Revival Surgery, Strange Reagent, and the Reviver Implant will restart
      your heart when you are revived
  NovaBot13:
  - bugfix: ' Hatsune mi-go now is a friendly gold slime mob, and doesn''t hurt your
      ears.'
  - rscadd: Hatsune mi-go drops a keyboard synth on death (you monster.)
  - code_imp: Whether something counts as a stimulant to All Nighter is now handled
      by the reagent itself when metabolized, for everyone's sanity. Side-effect,
      you need a liver to process stimulants for All Nighter.
  - balance: Fuel your sleep deprivation in style! Made more reagents work with All
      Nighter. This includes all coffee/tea variants, a few other drinks that would
      have a high enough caffeine level, kronkaine, ephedrine, and in case you're
      insane you can straight up eat coffee or tea grounds.
  - bugfix: Ethereal starvation has been updated to the new joules/watts standard.
      Congratulations Ethereals! You can starve again!
  - rscadd: Added a 'kaching' sound to the game, and made uplinks play this sound
      locally to the user whenever a purchase is made.
  - image: Supermatter slivers and the tools used to steal them have been resprited.
  - bugfix: Slime properly load their slowdown values from the config files.
  - bugfix: Slimes who lose their AI controller will no longer runtime when they get
      hungry.
  - qol: The eye of god now protects from the madness inducing effects of supermatter
      crystals and singularities. This trait is shared by the meson night vision goggles
      (which this is a better version of)
  - refactor: The Scan ability has been refactored into a pointed spell.
  - balance: The Scan ability has a lower cooldown of 35 seconds.
  - balance: The Scan ability now gives an advanced health scan readout of the target.
  - balance: Scanning someone alerts the target as to who is responsible, rather than
      being completely silent as to the culprit (much to the annoyance of anyone who
      is victimized by someone using this on them)
  - code_imp: The status effect that was called Stagger (not Staggered, which is separate)
      is now called Rebuked.
  - balance: Rebuked applies a x2 action delay cooldown, rather than x1.5.
  - bugfix: Slimes stop being in stasis when taken out of a BZ filled environment
  - bugfix: Slimes no longer become hungry while in stasis
  - bugfix: after 9 years, adds a single dot to the dragnet code, making it deal stamina
      damage as intended
  - rscadd: Prosthetic organ users are now allowed to pick what they want to start
      with.
  - rscadd: Junkie of all kinds, including smokers and alcoholics, are also able to
      pick their favorite type.
  - bugfix: anchored circuits no longer blow up after 2 components are used.

  Iajret:
  - bugfix: fixed wind turbines power generation and colony coffee machine taking
      literal ages to recharge
